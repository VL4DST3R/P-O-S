## Common problems

The game is quite demanding GPU-wise, if you are experiencing bad performance consider lowering the (very dense) foliage when roaming the island or reducing the render distance for effects like hair. We recommend not gowing lower than medium settings, as the visual impact is quite severe, try reducing the internal resolution instead.
